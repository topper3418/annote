Ok so I need to make this into a new framework 

I should make a generalizable type structuring system so that I can pass it in a pythonic, consistent way
I should make a primary prompt that focuses on getting the information we want
ISM a secondary prompt that forms it into
ISM a generalized way to add postprocessing and desired output
ISM a way to pass in error handling and a secondary prompt


just solve this first problem first though. 

process the entry using words. ask it to list off things and levels of confidence, as we would before. 
then either make that something thats attached to the types or just kinda have it set as a static filter where stuff is made or not. 
I think probably the best method would be to have them attach a confidence level to each and have the user approve or disapprove
Then we can have the json-forcing prompt go from there.
